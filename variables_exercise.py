Exercise #1: Secret Strings B-)

Part 1: Construct a program that takes in a string 
and returns a new string with the letters out of order (an anagram).

Hint: To get the third letter in "ball," use "ball"[2]. To get the last letter, use "ball"[len(ball)].

"""

def create_anagram(sequence):
    
    anagram = ""
    
    return anagram
    

"""
Part 2: Partner up, run the program, and see if your partner can figure out 
the original string after looking at the anagram version
"""

print(create_anagram("YOUR WORD HERE"))



"""
Exercise #2: Follow along with the code to see if you can figure out what 
the 'a', 'b', and 'c' hold at the end!

Check your answers with a print() statement
